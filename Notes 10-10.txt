dealing with uneven sampling:

interpolate?
	works well for dense red spectrun, poorly for others

Lomb/Scargle method:
	"least squares spectrum"
	lomb package, lsp function (lomb scargle periddogram)
	works for non regular sampling
	or spec.ls to get nice return (have to reinstal TSAUMN)
	- non parametric
	- no interpolation needed
	- can amelioratie aliasing
	- its a periodogram. ick! (inconcsistent estimator)
	- you can WOSA it (window)
	- spec.mtls()  multitaper lomb scargle
	- 
Coherency analysis:
	- do time series have related frequencies?
Bispectrum: 
	- 3rd moment (non linearities)
Evolutive spectra:
	- non stationary TS


more data wrangling

	- require(tiddyvesrs) it has all the good stuff
	- minus sign to drop columns, dplyr works or just [,-C(11:13)]
	- filter(dataframe, criteria) 
	- intersect(df,df) tells you what is in both lists
	- union(df,df) join df, no duplicates
	- joining dfs with different columns : full_join(Df,df) left_join, right_join adds from R to L or L to R. inner_join gives shared subjects
	- gather() and spread()
