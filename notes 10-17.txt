Convolution and Correlation and Coherence

Convolution:
 - basis of linear filtering
 - order of ops doesnt matter
 - simple example: an exponential and a delta function
 - R convolve fxn conj = FALSE
 - convoluution in time space = multiplication in frequency space (need to be same length)
 - "circular convolution" from R's method - don't want this to happen. Do extra zero padding to avoid this (type = filter)
 - popular with instrumentation "impulse response" comes from a delta fxn input
 - have to do deconvolution to get input response from instrument

Cross Correlation
 - NOT COMMUTATIVE
 - in frequency domain, it is the multiplication of one complex conjugate
 - autocorrelation/ auto covariance = g* star g
 - good for telling if and where series h appears in series i 

Coherence
 - Xi and Yi are ts
 - think Yi has a shifted and scaled version of Xi and noise
 - coherence will tell you at what time difference they will look alike
