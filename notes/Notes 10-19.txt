Short Filters

for smoothing: moving average is OK but you can do better
LTI (Lineat, time-invariant filtering):
	- w filter
	- r tiem series
	- s filtered 
	-then: s = r convolved with w


Smoothing a rough TS (low pass):
	- running mean
	- works better if the divid?g coefficient is allowed to chage @ each end of the TS
	-

get rid of low freq (hi pass)
	- basically subtract the low pass filtered series from the OG series

Derivative and integrals  of time series:
	- derivativeis a roughening filter/ noise amp
	- short derivatives cant get high freq
	- fdfilter - gives finitte difference coefficients
	-	integration smooths
