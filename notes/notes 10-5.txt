POWER SPECTRUM ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES

1. Periodogram
	- inconsistent
	-bad spectral leakage (rectangular window)
   WOSA variation
	- consistent
	- less spectral leakage
2. Blackman Tukey (moving average)
	-assumes moving average process
	- parametric
	- consistent
	-leakage okay
3. AR spectrum/Yule-walker/mmaximum entropy approach
	-ASSUME: an AR(p) process 
	- good for peaked spectra, others are better for smooth
	-estimates memory coefficients, variance of white noise to get power spec
	- no fourier transformation
	- DONT CALCULATE PAST THE NYQUIST
	- estimating P of AR(p) - let the comp take care
4. Multitaper method/Thompson's / MTM
	-non parrametric
	-find a set of tapers that gives good estimate
	- reduces spectral leakage
	-choose nw >= 1- the bigger it is the smoother the TS (bin size)
	- pick K = 2nw or 2nw-1 (k is intigetr)
	- can control smoothing

ALL REQUIRE:
- regularly sampled data
- go straight to multitaper to pick out obvious perodicity
-
