hw- hard edges show up in high freq

FILTERING
	-linear filter: filtered TS is a weighted sum of the input TS
	-Time-Invariant filter : weights depend only on time seperation, not absolute time
	-LTI (linear time invariant) can be written as a convolution of input 'x' and filter 'f'

	-Causal Filter: The effect must trail the cause. Output at time 'i' depends only on times prior to 'i'
	- Realizable FIlter: can be implemented in real time. Implies a causal filter. implies finite length implse response
	- cosfilt in TSAUMN does cosine filtering :tell it wher eyou want the filer == 1 and ==0, it will cos taper in between
	- 

- lanczos filter: important for graphics, climate studies "acausal FIR filter"
- need odd # points
- need a "corner freq" 

causal filters:
	-butterworth filter
	-Chebyshev filter
	-eliptic
inverse filter/deconvolution
kalman filters: linear, not time invariant; adapts to ts 
prediction filtering
