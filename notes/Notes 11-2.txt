Up and down sampling of TS

- changing the rate/interval without aliasing


UPsampling
- raising the sampling rate
- use an interpolation method: OK
- Shannon's interpolation: Exactly correct
- fft the TS,  double the nyquist, fill in power spectrum with zeroes to new nyyquist, IFFT back to time
	-this gives spectral leakage

downsampling
-uh oh aliasing danger ahead
- lower delta t reduces nyquist
- must filter out energy aboce new nyquist
- take every nth smaple
-use resample R fxn (not workinng)
- decimate r fxn in Signal or fftdecimate in TSAUMN
