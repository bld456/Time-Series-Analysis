principal component analysis example

pca review:  make a data mtrix, make a component matric, eigen vectors of component matrix are Principal COmponents
then the components can be weighted to make original data

fxns and 'apply'

-

some <- function(x, abs = FALSE, type = c(1,2,3)){
	n<- length(x)
	s<-0
	if (abs) x<- abs(x)
	for (i in 1:n) s<- s +x[i]
	return (s)
}


*abs will defaultto false
*type defaults to 1, wont throw an error if not equal to 1,2,3
* if types are strings, you canuse match.arg so user only need to know first letter. match.arg also fores user to input a valid type



APPLY
- apply(matrix, MARGIN = 1, function)   applies function to matrix, row by row. margin 2 is column by column
- apply (x, MARGIN = 1, function(x,y){sum(x^y)}, y=2)

faster than a for loop
works on matrix
lapply for lists
sapply for vectors
